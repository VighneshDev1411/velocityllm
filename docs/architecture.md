# VelocityLLM Architecture

## System Overview

VelocityLLM is designed as a distributed system with multiple components working together to provide high-performance LLM inference.

## Components

### 1. API Server (Go)
- Handles HTTP/gRPC requests
- Routes requests to appropriate workers
- Manages caching layer
- Collects metrics

### 2. Worker Pool (Python)
- Executes model inference
- Supports multiple models
- Implements batching
- Manages GPU resources

### 3. Caching Layer (Redis)
- Exact-match caching
- Semantic caching with embeddings
- Cache analytics

### 4. Database (PostgreSQL)
- Request logs
- Model configurations
- Usage analytics
- User management

### 5. Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)
- Real-time metrics
- Performance dashboards
- Alerting

## Request Flow
```
1. Client sends request â†’ API Server
2. API Server checks cache (Redis)
3. If cache miss:
   a. Router selects optimal model
   b. Request sent to Worker
   c. Worker generates response
   d. Response cached
4. Response returned to client
5. Metrics recorded
```

## Design Decisions

### Why Go for API Server?
- Excellent concurrency with goroutines
- Low latency
- Strong standard library
- Great for building APIs

### Why Python for Workers?
- Rich ML ecosystem
- vLLM requires Python
- Easy model integration

### Why gRPC?
- High performance
- Bi-directional streaming
- Strong typing with protobuf

## Scalability

- Horizontal scaling of workers
- Load balancing across worker pools
- Auto-scaling based on queue depth
- Database connection pooling

## Security

- API key authentication
- Rate limiting per key
- Input validation
- Secure credential storage
